# **MY PROCESS**
### **Build With**<pre>
-	HTML
-	CSS
-	FLEXBOX</pre>
### **What I Learnt**<pre>
So I just finished learning some tutorials on HTML and CSS, I decided to dive in some real project to see how well I’ve progressed.
Along the line on this challenge I realized there’s a whole lot of things I haven’t even heared of in CSS,
things like Flexbox so I decided to take some tutorial on in, and before then I was actually facing some serious problems going forward on this challenge,
only after learning flexbox did I manage to progress and complete the challenge.
So I’ll the most important thing I learnt from this challenge is Flexbox!</pre>
